# Recipe Calories

This is a simple project made with tailwind css and react js. I did not face any challenges while doing this project. But in the design of the project, I faced a little challenge in one place, and that is the table design of the side bar on the right side.
And while doing React's functionality, I have faced a little challenge in one place, and that is to add items on the right side side, because here I have to send items through lifting state up. ðŸ˜‹
